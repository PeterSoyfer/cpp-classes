Task named 'complex class' exploits the same idea of CFrac fraction class of rational numbers, but makes use of the OOP principles: initialisation methods are replaced with class constructors (three-fold polymorphism allows to construct a class instance either by default or by reference/by value), operational methods are replaced with the operators' overloading, other functions are designed in accordance with encapsulation and abstraction principles (usage of get_value/set_value idea and befriending a filling function infrac to the class). Also user-friendly interface with another good joke.
