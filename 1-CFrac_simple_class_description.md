Task named 'simple class' is meant to represent a simple C++ class of rational numbers (fractions) as they are defined in Number Theory:
equivalence class of pairs of integers (a, b) = "a / b" up to multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number.

  Features: three initialisation methods (default with no parameters, construct-by-reference and construct-by-value), 4 arithmetic operations (as methods),
comparison of fractions, resetting an instance of the class to zero (0/1), parser built from scratch for filling in the fraction from std I/O input,
finding the period of a fraction, checking if the fraction is proper, separating the whole part of a fraction.

  Also, as supportive methods, there are essential printing function, greatest common divisor method and a norming function which reflects the equivalence
principle for "a / b" class of congruent rational numbers. User interface via the command line (std I/O) and/or file data stream is designed to be of maximum safety
and friendliness (lovely joke added), handling all exceptions possible.
