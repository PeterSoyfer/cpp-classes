CStrList class was designed to introduce the concept of parsing the file line-by-line (built from scratch), printing the lines read,
finding the sub-string in the string read. Everything was designed with the idea of handling all the exceptions possible and maintaining
safe user-friendly interface via std I/O. It also has a sub-class CStr implemented for the sake of abstraction and data hiding, making
the interaction with the file being parsed much more convenient.
